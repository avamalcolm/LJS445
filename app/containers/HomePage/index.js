                   A late-fifteenth-century astronomical anthology, UPenn LJS 445 contains a diverse array of texts that reveal the importance of astronomical principles for many aspects of medieval life, as well as the fluidity of the boundary between manuscript and early print. Encompassing topics such as medicine, calendrical calculation, and prognostication, this sizeable codex includes material from three print volumes: Johannes Lichtenberger’s <i>Prognosticatio</i>, a book of astronomical predictions first published in 1488, and two editions of Johannes Regiomontanus’s <i>Calendarium</i>, both from the 1470s. In many cases, the scribe reproduces the characteristics of these editions, including title pages and image captions. Yet the layouts and illustrations of LJS 445 also draw on manuscript traditions and benefit from the greater flexibility of handwritten texts in this period, such as the potential for artists to create richly colored images and moveable volvelles.

					 Currently held at the <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak">Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, LJS 445 can be traced to Bavaria, and particularly to two of the sons of a Nuremberg patrician, Georg Veit (1573-1606) and Veit Engelhard (1581-1656) Holtzschuher. Its irregular quiring and partial copies of certain texts suggest that this codex was likely rebound at least once in its history. Now composed of 227 leaves with modern finding tabs, it also contains many signs of use, including spaces where images have been extracted, whimsical doodles, and shaky inscriptions by children learning the alphabet.

					This interactive facsimile of LJS 445 is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the many remarkable features of this manuscript. Click on <a href="http://aylinmalcolm.com/ljs445/reader">Browse</a> to scroll through its pages sequentially, or use the <a href="http://aylinmalcolm.com/ljs445/reader/penn/8">Tour this edition</a> option to view a series of “tour stops” highlighting some of its unusual characteristics. Marginal annotations and color-coded categories provide information about the content of each page and the thematic composition of the book, although these categories should be regarded as approximations of concepts that were in fact interconnected, given the medieval belief that celestial bodies exerted influences on terrestrial ones. Finally, the <a href="http://aylinmalcolm.com/ljs445/structure">Structure</a> view uses the VisColl data model to depict the physical makeup of this book, including quires of different sizes as well as missing and inserted leaves.
